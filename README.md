Importance of branches:

Isolated development: Enables work on new features or bug fixes without disrupting the main branch.
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different branches simultaneously.
Version management: Different versions of a project can be managed easily.
Process:

Create a Branch:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b new-feature
Make Changes:
Edit files and save changes.
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature"
Merge Branch:
Switch to the main branch.
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
Push changes to the remote repository.
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Pull Requests and Code Reviews
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
A pull request is a mechanism for developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. It facilitates code reviews by allowing team members to discuss the changes, suggest improvements, and approve or request modifications before merging the code into the main branch.

Steps to create a pull request:

Push your changes:
bash
Copy code
git push origin new-feature
Create a pull request:
Go to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
Click "New pull request."
Select the branch with your changes and the branch you want to merge into.

Create a workflow file:

In your repository, create a .github/workflows directory.
Add a file named ci.yml.
Define the workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
This workflow runs on every push to the main branch, sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
